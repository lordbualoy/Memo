SQL Server LocalDB is the current implementation of SQL Server Compact
Once LocalDB is installed you can use AttachDbFileName property of the connection string to "open" an MDF file. Keep in mind that the same file can only be opened by a single LocalDB instance (single Windows login) at any given time, so this is not a data-sharing feature.
